**Prerequisite**:  MATH B1B with a grade of "C" or better. Description: The purpose of this course is expose students 
to (1) the fundamental concepts of procedure oriented programming, (2) associated abstraction mechanisms and design 
processes, (3) the interface of software with the physical world (e.g. the use of sensors), and (4) the application of 
programming concepts to numenrical analysis techniques. This course utilizes the C/C++ programming language
**Course Corequisites**: NONE

## Student Learning Outcomes
1. Describe the basics of the architecture of a computer and its components.
2. Describe the principles of structured programming.
3. Describe, design, implement, and test structured programs using currently accepted methodology, and in particular to be able to do so for programs that control or otherwise interface with hardware by means of software.
4. Explain what an algorithm is and its importance in computer programming.
5. Apply numerical techniques to analyze and solve engineering-related problems.

## Equity and Inclusion

## Course Policies  
Each student in this course will abide by the Academic Honesty Policy described in the Academic Information and Standards section of the Bakersfield College Catalog. Collaboration in class while working on assignments is encouraged. Various projects in class will require group work. Students who do not participate equally with others on assigned group projects will receive a grade of zero.
Please be sensitive to the learning environment and the needs of each and every student in class. Avoid causing distractions or engaging in non-class activity. Turn cells phones off before class starts and respond only after class ends. Unless it is an emergency, do not leave class to answer the phone and do not text message. Do not conduct personal conversations when the instructor is lecturing. Disciplinary action including removal from class will result. Personal computers or other electronic devices are not to be used in class for non-class related activities. 

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Attendance will be tracked in Canvas. If you are late, it is your responsibility to notify me. This can be done through Canvas or after my lecture is over. Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. Being late twice will count as 1 absent. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in class schedule and in the college website under the “Important Dates” section. It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, will be marked absent upon their early departure.
